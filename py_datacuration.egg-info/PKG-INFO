# The py-datacuration package

This package contains data curation tools and functions most commonly used.

## Why this package?

This package was originally created for a Jupyter Notebook binder (a directory with many Notebooks) sharing this common library of common functions used across most Notebooks.

When we run the the `BinderReadme` notebook, we want to differentiate between functions that we create and those that are imported from other libraries. Having our reusable functions/classes within a package creates tags that appear on our functions that tell us that our functions are unique to the datacuration package. Without packaging and installing our datacuration modules, the module functions would be treated as global and thus do not appear linked to the datacuration package. Packages must be installed to function as a package.

If we are wanting to update the `BinderReadme` notebook, we need to increment the version in the `setup.py` script and install the updated package within the notebook.

## Who should use this package?

Anyone wishing to make use of the `BinderReadme` notebook needs to install this package or other Python apps that need common data curation functions.

## Cloning the package

`git clone --config core.autocrlf=false https://github.com/kuhlaid/py-datacuration.git`
